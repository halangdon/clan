## 🧭 Project Overview

This repository contains the source files for our interactive family tree.

- `index.html` — The main page where the tree is rendered.  
- `assets/images/` — Folder containing member photos.  
- `assets/css/style.css` — Optional custom styles.  
- `assets/js/main.js` — Optional custom JavaScript (e.g., expanding/collapsing logic).

## 🧩 How to Update the Tree

1. Edit `index.html` or the main config JSON (if you move to dynamic setup).
2. Add new members following the same structure.
3. (Optional) Add their photo to `assets/images/` and update the `image` field.
4. Commit and push changes to `main` branch.
5. GitHub Pages will auto-update within a few minutes.
